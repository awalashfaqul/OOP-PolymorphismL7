# OOP-PolymorphismL7

The code is written in C# (C-sharp).  

Through this assignment, gained knowledge and understandings about using polymorphism in object-oriented programming. 
The task is largely about devising a structure for polymorphism.

Created a ParentClass, Geometry{} to the other classes that will inherit from it. It has a method called Area() with return type double.

Created five other classes (Rectangle, Square, Circle, Parallelogram and Ellipse) that will inherit from the Geometry class.
All these classes also have a method called Area().

Each class has its own property.

All ChildClasses override the Area() method with different area implementations for different child classes.

In the Main() method,  created an object reference from the Geometry class and it point to an object in each class.
